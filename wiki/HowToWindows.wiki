#summary How to use overplayed with Windows.

= System Requirements =

   * *Windows 7* or *8*, *32-bit* or *64-bit* has been tested, but the server should work on any version of Windows that PPJoy Supports

   * *PPJoy* installed with at least *one virtual joystick* created.

= PPJoy installation (only has to be done once) =

PPJoy is a virtual joystick that the server uses to send game controller input to games and applications. 

  * PPJoy can be downloaded at:
      * *32-bit*: http://ppjoy.bossstation.dnsalias.org/
      * *64-bit*: https://code.google.com/p/steel-batallion-64/downloads/detail?name=ppjoysetup-0-8-4-6.exe
          * *_Note 64-bit Windows Vista, 7, or 8 only (except Ultimate):_ Windows will be put in test mode upon installation.*
              * It does not affect Windows except for a logo at the bottom right corner of the desktop. A helpful article explaining this can be found here: http://www.jim-melton.com/tag/ppjoy-windows-7-64-bit/ And the Microsoft knowledge base for reverting it can be found at: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509241 (but this will disable PPJoy)

  * After installation:
      * Run *Configure Game Controllers*
      * Click *Add...*
      * Click *Add*
      * Click *Done*

   * To change what port the server uses, use the port number as an argument when running the server, i.e. overplayed 12345.
   * overplayed only uses UDP, in case you want to port forward.
   * x360ce (xbox 360 controller emulator: https://code.google.com/p/x360ce/) can be used for maximum game compatibility. A configuration file I made can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/overplayed/downloads/detail?name=x360ce.ini
